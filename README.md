Code for the "SPATIAL ANALYSIS OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SCHOOL PROXIMITY AND CRIME" article

This repository contains the code for the Article authored by Leonardo de Castro Harth and Bangxi Xiao and Shane T. Jensen. 

The regression analysis and the Propensity Matching Score analysis use Environments saved in the Data Wrangling code files. The Environments are uploaded, but minor changes are expected if the code is ran today with updated data (crime data, code violation data, and so on).

Please feel free to contact me with any question regarding the code.
